This is an introduction to the way LaTeX math equations can be used in github. If written inline an equation can be composed like this: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x)%20=%20\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}%20c_n\left(x%20-%20a\right)^n=c_0%20%2b%20c_1\left(x%20-%20a\right)%20%2B%20c_2\left(x%20-%20a\right)^2%20%2B%20\ldots">.
Because modern web-browsers encode URL automatically, LaTeX can be written directly into a URL and then referenced as an <em>img</em>. This is a workaround for a lack of native support for LaTeX in github markdown notes.
